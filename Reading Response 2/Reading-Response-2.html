    <h2>The Five Basics of HTML</h2>
    <p>The article, "Five Things You Should Know About HTML 5," examined several key distinctions that need to be made when discussing HTML 5. The five main points about HTML found in the article were: "It's Not One Big Thing, You Don't Need to Throw Anything Away, It's Easy to Get Started, It Already Works, and It's Here to Stay." The first point of the article talked about how HTML 5 is not a radically different version of HTML but rather just a new version of HTML that contains several new features. The second point of the article focused on the fact that just because you wrote code in HTML does not mean that that code is no longer valid, but rather that all former HTML code still runs. The author succinctly summed this poiont up when he wrote that, "You don't need to throw away your existing markup. You don't need to relearn things you already know. If your web application worked yesterday in HTML 4, it will still work today in HTML 5. Period." The third point of the article detailed how to start writing code in the HTML format while the fourth point of the article outlined programs where HTML 5 is already supported. The fifth and final point summed up the main emphasis of the article best, concluding that, "HTML5 is here to stay. Let's Dive In." All in all the article made the point that the evolution of HTML 5 is a good thing and that the past versions of HTML are still visible and functionable.

    <h2>The History of HTML</h2>
    <p>The early first section of the article, "A Quite Biased History of HTML 5" provides us with a detailed account of the formation of HTMl, and in particular the role that standardization played in the development of a more unified code. The early portion of the article was organized in a really unique manner as it showed the exchange of dialogue between several of the markee early computer programmers and the resulting standarization of many basic coding functions such as the img image code abbreviation. The back half of the article looks at the transtion from HTML to the more advanced XHTML as well as the subsequent formation of the "What Working Group," which contrasted the stricter W3C group. All in all the article was very enlightening, and I particuarly was intrigued by the general continuity of HTML. The article perfectly summed up the history of HTML when the author wrote, "HTML is an ubroken line. A twisted, knotted, snarled line, to be sure...But still. Here we are, in 2012, and web pages from 1990 still render in modern browsers."

    <h2>The VT Student</h2>
    <p>The VT student can best be summarized as a well-rounded student that is both well-educated as well as service oriented. The VT student places a large amount of emphasis on the collective improvement of the group rather than just merely on personal success and embodies a spirit of unselfish virtue. In many ways the VT student embodies many characteristics that are commonly associated with the chivalric medevial hero.</p>
    <h2>Questions?</h2>
    <p>Why did HTML develop as a program which allowed for errors to be made and still run? What does the future of HTML look like? How many people contributed to the development of HTML?</p>
